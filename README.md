# ImagineRIT Line-Following Car Competition

Firmware for the 2017 Line-Following Car Competition at Imagine RIT.

This code was able to complete smaller tracks at low speeds in a test
environment, but not the final race track at higher speeds.

`src/main.c` contains the main driving algorithms. `src` also contains a
collection of reusable drivers for the NXP FRDM-K64F.
